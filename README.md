# Customer-Segmentation
In today's data-driven world, understanding customers is the key to successful marketing strategies. 🎯 Through an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Mall Customer Segmentation Project, I've unearthed valuable insights that will revolutionize the approach to customer engagement. Here's what I've discovered:

# The Dataset Source : Kaggle

# 1. Univariate Analysis:

📈 Most annual incomes fall within the range of 50K to 85K, indicating a significant segment of potential high-spending customers.
👵👴 Customers span a wide variety of ages, with no dominant age group.
💳 The maximum spending score ranges from 40 to 60, suggesting a diverse spending behavior among customers.
👩‍🦰👨‍🦰 There are more female customers than male, with females exhibiting a higher average spending score and a slightly lower average age.

# 2. Bivariate Analysis:

📊 There seems to be no clear relationship between income and spending score, although clusters do form.
👥 The 26-35 age group constitutes the largest customer segment.
💰 Most customers have an annual income between 61-90 thousand dollars, indicating potential high-value customers.
📉 A slight inverse relationship (-0.33) between age and spending score was observed.

# 3. Multivariate Analysis:

🔄 Overall, there isn't a significant correlation between variables, indicating complex interactions at play.




# 🌟 Conclusion:

These insights provide with a solid foundation for crafting targeted marketing strategies tailored to specific customer segments. 💼💡
