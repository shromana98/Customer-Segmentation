# Customer-Segmentation Part 1
Customer segmentation is the method of distributing a customer base into collections of people based on mutual characteristics so organizations can market to group efficiently and competently individually. 
In today's data-driven world, understanding customers is the key to successful marketing strategies. 🎯 Through an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Mall Customer Segmentation Project, I've unearthed valuable insights that will revolutionize the approach to customer engagement. Here's what I've discovered:

# The Dataset Source : Kaggle

# 1. Univariate Analysis:

📈 Most annual incomes fall within the range of 50K to 85K, indicating a significant segment of potential high-spending customers.
👵👴 Customers span a wide variety of ages, with no dominant age group.
💳 The maximum spending score ranges from 40 to 60, suggesting a diverse spending behavior among customers.
👩‍🦰👨‍🦰 There are more female customers than male, with females exhibiting a higher average spending score and a slightly lower average age.

# 2. Bivariate Analysis:

📊 There seems to be no clear relationship between income and spending score, although clusters do form.
👥 The 26-35 age group constitutes the largest customer segment.
💰 Most customers have an annual income between 61-90 thousand dollars, indicating potential high-value customers.
📉 A slight inverse relationship (-0.33) between age and spending score was observed.

# 3. Multivariate Analysis:

🔄 Overall, there isn't a significant correlation between variables, indicating complex interactions at play.




# 🌟 Conclusion:

These insights provide with a solid foundation for crafting targeted marketing strategies tailored to specific customer segments. 💼💡 

# Customer-Segmentation Part 2

Through the application of various unsupervised learning techniques, I have effectively segmented customers and identified the most suitable model for the dataset. Delving into clustering methods such as KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), I meticulously analyzed each model's performance to draw meaningful insights.

In today's data-driven world, understanding customers is the key to successful marketing strategies. Its important to pinpoint the target customers who will drive success. Here's what I've discovered:


# 🔍 Univariate Clustering: 
By analyzing the Within Cluster Sum of Squared Errors (WSS) and the elbow curve, I have identified the optimal number of clusters to categorize the customers based on Annual Income. The insights gained pave the way for precision targeting.

# 🔍 Bivariate Clustering:
📊Clustering based on Spending Score & Annual Income: Using the elbow method, I have determined the ideal number of clusters based on these two critical features. 

This predicts which customers have more money and spending score is high..

💸 Spending Score & Age: Another dynamic duo! By employing the elbow method once again, I have uncovered clusters that reveal age groups with high spending scores. 

It predicts which age group has spending score high.

# 📈 Multivariate Clustering: 
Armed with Silhouette Scores for KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and GMMs, I dived deeper into segmentation. And Found the optimal no of clusters and the best model. KMeans exhibited superior performance for this customer segmentation task. 

 Each cluster holds the key to tailored growth tactics aimed at enhancing customer lifetime value and profit margins.


# 🌟 Conclusion:

With a clear understanding of customer segments, and implementing targeted marketing campaigns, personalized promotions, and tailored product offerings profit can be increased.
